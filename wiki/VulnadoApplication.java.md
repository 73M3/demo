# Documentation: `VulnadoApplication.java`

## Overview
The `VulnadoApplication` class serves as the entry point for a Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ServletComponentScan`, enabling Spring Boot's auto-configuration and scanning for servlet components. The application also includes a call to a static method `Postgres.setup()` before starting the Spring Boot application context.

---

## Class: `VulnadoApplication`

### Annotations
- **`@SpringBootApplication`**: 
  - Combines the functionality of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
  - Marks this class as the primary configuration class for the Spring Boot application.
- **`@ServletComponentScan`**: 
  - Enables scanning for servlet components such as `@WebServlet`, `@WebFilter`, and `@WebListener` annotations within the application.

### Methods
#### `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Acts as the entry point for the Java application.
  - Initializes the Spring Boot application context.
- **Logic**:
  1. Calls `Postgres.setup()` to perform any necessary setup for the PostgreSQL database.
  2. Invokes `SpringApplication.run(VulnadoApplication.class, args)` to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

## Insights
- **Database Setup**: 
  - The `Postgres.setup()` method is invoked before starting the application. This suggests that the application relies on a PostgreSQL database, and the setup method likely handles tasks such as establishing a connection, initializing schemas, or seeding data.
  
- **Servlet Component Scanning**: 
  - The use of `@ServletComponentScan` indicates that the application may include custom servlets, filters, or listeners that are registered via annotations rather than programmatically.

- **Spring Boot Framework**: 
  - The application leverages Spring Boot's auto-configuration and dependency injection features, simplifying the development of enterprise-grade applications.

- **File Name**: 
  - The file is named `VulnadoApplication.java`, which aligns with the convention of naming the main application class after the project or module.

---

## Dependencies
- **Spring Boot**: 
  - Provides the core framework for building and running the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: 
  - The application interacts with a PostgreSQL database, as indicated by the call to `Postgres.setup()`.

---

## Execution Flow
1. The `main` method is executed.
2. `Postgres.setup()` is called to prepare the database.
3. The Spring Boot application context is initialized and started using `SpringApplication.run`.
