# Documentation: `VulnadoApplication.java`

## Overview
The `VulnadoApplication` class serves as the entry point for a Spring Boot application. It is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` and `@ServletComponentScan`, enabling Spring Boot's auto-configuration and scanning for servlet components. The application also includes a call to a static method `Postgres.setup()` before starting the Spring Boot application context.

## Class: `VulnadoApplication`

### Annotations
- **`@SpringBootApplication`**: 
  - Combines the functionality of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
  - Marks this class as the primary configuration class for the Spring Boot application.
- **`@ServletComponentScan`**: 
  - Enables scanning for servlet components (e.g., `@WebServlet`, `@WebFilter`, `@WebListener`) within the application.

### Methods
#### `public static void main(String[] args)`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Acts as the entry point for the Java application.
  - Initializes the Spring Boot application context.
- **Key Operations**:
  1. **`Postgres.setup()`**:
     - A static method call to set up the PostgreSQL database. The implementation of this method is not provided in this file.
  2. **`SpringApplication.run(VulnadoApplication.class, args)`**:
     - Starts the Spring Boot application by creating and initializing the application context.

## Insights
- **Database Setup**: 
  - The `Postgres.setup()` method suggests that the application requires a PostgreSQL database. This method likely handles database initialization or configuration.
- **Servlet Scanning**: 
  - The use of `@ServletComponentScan` indicates that the application may include custom servlets, filters, or listeners that need to be registered with the servlet container.
- **Spring Boot Framework**: 
  - The application leverages Spring Boot's auto-configuration and dependency injection features, simplifying the setup and configuration process.
